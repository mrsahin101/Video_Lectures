# FIFTH DRAFT

### WHY TO WRITE?
        Writing is technically sophisticated thinking. You can make your thinking more elegant, and more powerful. Writing is a good way 
    to produce arguments. You write about something you don't know the answer to. The reason to write about it is the best way to think.
    It makes you a better thinker. Makes you the better winner. If you communicate effectively it makes you always better. Doesn't matter
    what you do.



### HOW TO WRITE?
        The first step is to produce the problem you want to write. You want to write about something you don't know the answer to. 
    An essay is an attempt to formulate the problem more clearly and try to solve it. You do your background research. After background 
    research, you know about the problem of the domain. 

        Start to write without self-editing. This is a common mistake. Leave editing for later. Because you can't come up with high-quality
    content and manner. That's why have to break it into steps. You write everything and when you stuck you write I am stuck here. You don't
    wanna stop or you don't wanna criticize yourself. Don't worry about the sentences. Then after you write all your thoughts you do the first 
    draft. It goes the same for life. When learning in life you gotta break old ideas to open up to new ideas and get better with ideas and
    improve yourself. After you finished. Then you edit it. You throw it useless content. But that's okay because if you want to produce 
    high-quality content this process is necessary.




### WHY EDIT?  
        Because you are exploring it's okay to throw it up. You are taking chances. The more iteration is made the more likely to get a better
    essay or research. You want to drive a reader to a conclusion. Make it as exciting as a journey. This is not only for writing, but also 
    thinking about something. It helps a lot. Hemingway was throwing a little bit away. He was a good writer.
    
   

### HOW TO EDIT?
        When you edit throw each word in the sentence possible and still, it makes sense. Try to shorten the sentence by %25. After you have 
    the first draft you edit it. When editing put the first draft left side and then edit on a new clean paper and edit constantly. 

        Cut it into pieces out and write the second draft. Go by each sentence by sentence, word by word, paragraph by paragraph cut it out,
    reorganize it, and question your thought process. Keep doing this recursively. Until you believe that you can't improve it any more. But
    this doesn't mean that what you have written isn't improvable.

        What's the conceptual framework for editing: The words should be the right words. Make sure each word is exact for that sentence. 
    Phrases are properly phrased. Make sure each paragraph is in context with other paragraphs. You write each sentence again again again. 
    Then choose between sentences and throw others. Then reorder the sentences. Often Jordan Peterson keeps throwing sentences in some document.
    If you wanna think something through this is how you do it.



### CONCLUSION
        Those who formulate their arguments win. Life is about negotiating. You have to write constantly. You have to give it every day some
    chunk of time. You can get a tremendous distance in a year. When writing there is a hard part to it. If you pass that hardness something 
    massive opens up on the other side. When writing about your past makes you shed baggage. If you write about your future it is much more  
    likely to make you put your plans into action and make you more successful. Never postponed stuff. Do it in flow. Try to write every day.

### SUGGESTIONS
        When you do recursive iteration your words have rhythm. That makes it more readable and enjoyable. When you write afterward read it aloud. 
    When you write about your past it tends to clear you up. Shed the baggage you carry. When writing about the future may make you successful.

- Peterson Writing 10 steps
    1. Find a **reason** for writing
    2. Understand the **complexity** of language: words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and sequences of paragraphs.
    3. Make a list of interesting **topics** and a list of **reading material** that will inform you about those topics, read the material, take notes, and identify **ideas** that interest you.
    4. Choose **topics** and make and **outline** 
    5. **Draft** sentences for each outline element.
    6. Create **variations** of your draft sentences, read your sentences, aloud to find phrases that flow well, and rearrange the written sentences into paragraphs.
    7. **Re-order** your paragraphs.
    8. Create a **new outline** from memory, and slot your paragraphs into the new outline.
    9. **Rewrite** and **reorder** your sentences and paragraphs.
    10. Add **references** for facts, opinions, and quotations that you need to attribute to other people.



- Conceptual framework for editing.
    1. Words should be the right words. Make sure words are the exact way of expressing the idea.
    2. Make sure words fit together strongly. Each sentence has strongly fitted together
    3. Each paragraph is sequenced properly together. 
    4. Each paragraph and section must be sequenced together properly. 
    5. You write sentences again. And then choose between sentences. Re-order them.
    6. When you decide you can't make it any better you are done. But it doesn't mean it's best because you can't do it any better means making better is impossible. 
    7. Try not to go too far into editing.
    8. Depending on the subject maybe try to get feedback. Being criticized is a good thing.
    9. When editing reading sentences a loud could be very helpful. it cleans up thinking.
