After background research, you know about the problem of the domain. When writing about your past it makes you shed baggage. If you write about your future it is much more likely to make you put your plans into action and make you more successful.Writing is a good way to produce arguments.The first step is to produce the problem you want to write. The reason to write is about you trying to solve some problem. You write about something you don't know the answer to. This is the same for a talk.When writing trying to edit. That won't work. Just write. Don't try to edit it. Because you can't come up with high-quality content and manner.

    After you have the first draft you edit it. When editing you throw it out. Useless content.Because you are exploring it's okay to throw it up. You taking chances.It goes the same for life. When learning in life you gotta break old ideas to open up to new learning paths and get better ideas and improve yourself.Gotta check maps of meaning and 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson.After getting the first draft cut it into pieces out and write the second draft. Go by each sentence by sentence, word by word, paragraph by paragraph cut it out, reorganize it, and question your thought process. Keep doing this recursively. Until you believe that you can't improve it any more. But this doesn't mean that what you have written isn't improvable.If you wanna think something through this is how you do it.What's the conceptual framework for editing: The words should be the right words. Make sure each word is exact for that sentence. Phrases are properly phrased. Make sure each paragraph is in context with other paragraphs. You write each sentence again again again. Then choose between sentences and throw others. Then reorder the sentences. Often Jordan Peterson keeps throwing sentences in some document.being criticized is a good thing.Write the first draft as fastest you can. When you do recursive iteration your words have rhythm. That makes it more readable and enjoyable.When you write afterward read it aloud.

Those who formulate their arguments win. Life is about negotiating.Hemingway was throwing a little bit away. He was a good writer.You have to write constantly. You have to give it every day some chunk of time. You can get a tremendous distance in a year.Before writing, you have to do background research. Get knowledge about the domain or do thinking about a subject. When writing there is a hard part to it. If you pass that hardness something massive opens up on the other side.Then instantly start writing without worrying about editing in the first place.

    You write down everything. If you are stuck you write I'm stuck here. Then after you write all your thoughts you do the first draft. Then you edit it.You throw it useless content. But that's okay because if you want to produce high-quality content this process is necessary.Don't edit while you producing. Leave it after you finish writing.When editing put the first draft left side and then edit on a new clean paper and edit constantly. You want to write something you don't know the answer to.The reason to write about it, is the best way to think. It makes you a better thinker. When writing about your past it makes you shed baggage.
