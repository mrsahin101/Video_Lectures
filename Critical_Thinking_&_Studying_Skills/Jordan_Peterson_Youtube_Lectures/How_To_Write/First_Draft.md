https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3otsJZWKbk

- First of all, you need a subject(problem) to write on. -> You want to have a problem you want to solve. 

- You want to drive a reader to a conclusion. Make it as exciting as a journey.

- This is not actually only for writing, but also thinkering about something. It helps alot
- Have to write without self editing. constantly write. leave editing for later.
- Writing is good ways to produce arguments
- First step is produce problem you want to write. Reason to write is about you trying to solve some problem. You write about something you dont know the answer. This is same for a talk.
- Essay is attempt to formulate the problem more clearly and trying to solve it. You do your background research. First you have to problem. After background research you have knowledge about problem of the domain. 
- When writing trying to edit. That wont work. Just write. dont try to edit it. Because you cant come up with high quality content and manner. Thats why have to break it to into steps.
- You write everything and when you stuck you write i stuck here.You dont wanna stop or you dont wanna critisize yourself. You dont worry about the sentences. After you have first draft you edit it. When editing you throw it out. Useless content.
- Because you are exploring its okay to throw it up. You taking chances.
- It goes same for life. When learning in life you gotta break old ideas to open up to new learning path and get better ideas and improve yourself.

- Gotta check maps of meaning and 12 Rules for life by Jordan Peterson.

- After getting first draft cut it into pieces out and write second draft. Go by each sentence by sentence, words by words, paragraph by paragraph cut it out, reorganize it, question your thought process. Keep do this recursively. Until you believe that you cant improve it anymore. But this doesnt mean that what you have written isnt improvable.
- If you wanna think something through this is how you do it.

- Whats the conceptual framework for editing : The words should be right words. Make sure each word is exact for that sentence. Phrases is properly phrased. Make sure each paragraphs are in context with other paragraphs. You write each sentence again again again. Then choose between sentences and throw others. Then reorder the sentences. Often Jordan Peterson keep throw sentences in some document.
- being criticize is good thing.
- Write first draft as fastest you can.
- When you do recursive iteration you words have rhytm. Thats makes it more readable and more enjoyable.
- When you write afterwards read it aloud.
- When you write about your past it tends to clears you up. Shed baggage of you carrying. When writing about future it may makes you succesfull. Writing is technically sophisticated thinking.
- Those who formulate their arguments they win. Life is about negotiating.,
- Hemingway was throwing little bit away. He was good writer.
- You have to write constantly. You have give it everyday some chunk of time. You can get tremendous distance in a year.
- Before writing, you have to do background research. Get knowledge about the domain or do thinking about a subject.

- When writing there is hard part to it. If you pass that hardness something massive opens up on the otherside.

- Then instantly start writing without worrying about editing in the first place.

- You write down everything. If you are stuck you write I'm stuck here. Then after you write all your thoughts you do the first draft. Then you edit it. 
    You throw it useless content. But that's okay because if you want to produce high-quality content this process is necessary.

- Don't edit while you producing. Leave it after you finish writing.

- When editing put the first draft left side and then edit on a new clean paper and edit constantly.
- You want to write something you dont know the answer to.

- Conceptual framework for editing.
    1. Words should be the right words. Make sure words are the exact way of expressing the idea.
    2. Make sure words fit together strongly. Each sentence has strongly fitted together
    3. Each paragraph is sequenced properly together. 
    4. Each paragraph and section must be sequenced together properly. 
    5. You write sentences again. And then choose between sentences. Re-order them.
    6. When you decide you can't make it any better you are done. But it doesn't mean it's best because you can't do it any better means making better is impossible. 
    7. Try not to go too far into editing.
    8. Depending on the subject maybe try to get feedback. Being criticized is a good thing.
    9. When editing reading sentences a loud could be very helpful. it cleans up thinking.

- The reason to write about it, is the best way to think. It makes you a better thinker. 

- When writing about your past it makes you shed baggage. If you write about your future it is much more likely to make you put your plans into action and make you more successful.

- Writing is technically sophisticated thinking. You can make your thinking more elegant, and more powerful. Makes you the better winner. 

- If you communicate effectively it makes you always better. doesn't matter what you do.

- When you edit throw each word in the sentence possible and still it makes sense. Try to shorten the sentence by %25.

- Never postponed stuff. Do it in flow. Try to write every day.

- In summary
    1. Write to improve your thinking.
    2. Draft quickly and without judgment.
    3. Read aloud what you wrote.
