- First of all, you need a subject(problem) to write on. -> You want to have a problem you want to solve. 

- You want to drive a reader to a conclusion. Make it as exciting as a journey.

- Before writing, you have to do background research. Get knowledge about the domain or do thinking about a subject.

- Then instantly start writing without worrying about editing in the first place.

- You write down everything. if you are stuck you write I'm stuck here. Then after you write all your thoughts you do the first draft. Then you edit it. 
    You throw it useless content. But that's okay because if you want to produce high-quality content this process is necessary.

- Don't edit while you producing. Leave it after you finish writing.

- When editing put the first draft left side and then edit on a new clean paper and edit constantly.

- Conceptual framework for editing.
    1. Words should be the right words. Make sure words are the exact way of expressing the idea.
    2. Make sure words fit together strongly. Each sentence has strongly fitted together
    3. Each paragraph is sequenced properly together. 
    4. Each paragraph and section must be sequenced together properly. 
    5. You write sentences again. And then choose between sentences. Re-order them.
    6. When you decide you can't make it any better you are done. But it doesn't mean it's best because you can't do it any better means making better is impossible. 
    7. Try not to go too far into editing.
    8. Depending on the subject maybe try to get feedback. Being criticized is a good thing.
    9. When editing reading sentences a loud could be very helpful. it cleans up thinking.

- The reason to write about it, is the best way to think. It makes you a better thinker. 

- When writing about your past it makes you shed baggage. If you write about your future it is much more likely to make you put your plans into action and make you more successful.

- Writing is technically sophisticated thinking. You can make your thinking more elegant, and more powerful. Makes you the better winner. 

- If you communicate effectively it makes you always better. doesn't matter what you do.

- When you edit throw each word in the sentence possible and still it makes sense. Try to shorten the sentence by %25.

- Never postponed stuff. Do it in flow. Try to write every day.

- In summary
    1. Write to improve your thinking.
    2. Draft quickly and without judgment.
    3. Read aloud what you wrote.
    4. Make time to write.
