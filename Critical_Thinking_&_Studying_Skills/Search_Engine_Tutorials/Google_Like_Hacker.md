- Using search engines is basically doing a query to database. That's why we need to use it effectively.
- Use time filter if needed.
- When we put **"text"** we wanna search, it will give us exact result of text without doing operation on it. 
- Also if we use **-** minus symbol it will disregard those words comes after minus symbol.
- if we use **filetype:** we can specify file type we are looking for.
- we can use **site:** to specify site we looking for.
- Use **google.com/advanced_search** to search more advancedly.
