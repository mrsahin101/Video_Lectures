# CALIBRATION TECHNIQUES FOR ANALOG SENSORS AND MIXED SIGNAL SYSTEMS
- Opamp compares 2 signal

- Because of resistor tolerance, opamp gains could be change. And that can cause error in measurment and there is always offset error.
- Also input bias current causes Gain and Offset error.
- Error correction could be done in MCU instead of hardware.
