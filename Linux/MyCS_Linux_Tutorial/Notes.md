# LINUX TUTORIAL FOR BEGINNERS 
- Most top directory is **root** directory.
- **cd ..** : Moves to up directory.
- **cd** : Quick way to go home. or **cd ~** also goes home.
- When we call **ls -l** if first letter is **-** is file, or if its **d** its a directory
- **ls -a** : Shows all files. Including hidding files.
- Hidding files are names starts with **.** character.
- rmdir s* : remove directory start with letter s.
- **touch file.txt** : Creates empty file.txt
- **wc** : Show number of words in given file.
- **less file.txt** : Shows content of file page by page.
- Changing file extension doesnt change file content on linux. But it is common sense to inform user with certain extensions.
- There is no trashbin on terminal. If file deleted, its gone! So be carefull.
- **locate** : Tells about application and its files. It gives complete path.It may not locate recently created files.
- **which** : Find executable of given name file.
- **grep -v "printf" main.c > myoutput.txt** : Find printf's in main and direct it into myoutput.txt(write into it)
- **stdin** : Standart input, **stdout** : Standart output, **stderr** : Standart error
- When redirecting output, stdout writes to file, stderr still prints on terminal.
- When using **&>** redirects stderr and stdout into file.
- To append to file use **>>** instead of **>**.
- **|** : Pipes are great for using 2 command together.
- Paused process are can be seen by **jobs** command.
- **fg** will bring process to runing again. It's abbrivetion for foreground
- **bg** will work process in background. Its abbrivetion for background 
- **ps** : Shows process running in terminal.
