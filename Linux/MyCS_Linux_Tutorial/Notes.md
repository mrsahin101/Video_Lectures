# LINUX TUTORIAL FOR BEGINNERS 
- Most top directory is **root** directory.
- **cd ..** : Moves to up directory.
- **cd** : Quick way to go home. or **cd ~** also goes home.
- When we call **ls -l** if first letter is **-** is file, or if its **d** its a directory
- **ls -a** : Shows all files. Including hidding files.
- Hidding files are names starts with **.** character.
- rmdir s* : remove directory start with letter s.
- **touch file.txt** : Creates empty file.txt
- **wc** : Show number of words in given file.
- **less file.txt** : Shows content of file page by page.
- Changing file extension doesnt change file content on linux. But it is common sense to inform user with certain extensions.
