# Video_Lectures
Video lectures I go through to improve my skills

# What is this for? 

- This repo is for video lectures I try to improve my skills. It will contain notes, reminders, and some details about subjects.

- Video lectures could be from Youtube, Edx, Coursera, Udacity, and such online open resources.

- After getting ideas and writing them down, I will be thinking about them formulating them, and trying to drive conclusions from them to become better thinker and solve engineering problems.
